# About the Project

The purpose of this project is to simulate the War Card Game. The deck starts out with 52 cards. Then, upon clicking play:
 - The deck is shuffled and divided into two. 
 - One for player 1 and the other for player 2. 
 - The winner is determined by whichever player has the higher card. 
 - The loser gives up their card and that card gets pushed into the winner's deck.
